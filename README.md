# ArrowDirectionPythonOpenCV
This is part of my software implementation done for the IESL Robo Games competition, where I used python with opencv on raspberry Pi environment to process camera input of the path and direct the robot to do its movements. Basically the algorithm gives the output to keep the robot on the line by giving a measure of gap between center of camera with line center and the major part of algorithm is to give the live angle needed to rotate the robot , by processing the arrow head at the junction.
